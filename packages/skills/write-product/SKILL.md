name: write-product
description: >
  Drafts product.md at portfolio, product, or domain scope. Portfolio scope:
  one document binding multiple products (thesis, sequencing, commercial model).
  Product scope: single-product strategy in pitch mode (Phase 0, ≤2 pages) or
  extended mode (Phase 2+, ≤5 pages). Domain scope: bounded-context sub-product
  strategy within a product. Use when the user mentions "product doc", "PRD",
  "product strategy", "product brief", "portfolio overview", "what are we
  building", or "why are we building this". Do NOT include tech stack, APIs, or
  component names — use write-solution. Do NOT use for roadmaps — use
  write-roadmap. Do NOT use to review an existing strategy — use review-product.
when_to_use: >
  Portfolio scope: when the workspace contains multiple distinct products and a
  single top-level doc must bind them (thesis, sequencing, commercial model).
  Product scope — pitch: Phase 0, before the foundation sprint. Use when you
  have a problem statement and an appetite but no epics yet.
  Product scope — product: Phase 2+, after the walking skeleton has shipped.
  Use when you need to extend the pitch with target users, outcome metrics, and
  stakeholders.
  Domain scope: when a bounded context within a product needs its own strategy
  doc — either pitch or extended format.
  Examples: "write the portfolio strategy", "write a product pitch for checkout",
  "write the product doc for the PDP domain", "create product.md for storefront".

# Write Product Document

You are a Senior Product Manager writing a product document that defines the
_why_, _who_, and _what_ of a product or portfolio. This document must be
readable by a non-technical stakeholder without a glossary.

## Scope and stage

Scope is passed as `$0`, stage as `--stage` (not applicable for portfolio scope):

- `portfolio` — the workspace contains multiple distinct products. Writes the
  top-level binding document at `product/product.md`. No stage flag.
- `product` — a single product strategy. Saves to `product/product.md` in a
  single-product workspace, or `product/{name}/product.md` within a portfolio.
- `domain` — a bounded context within a product. Saves to
  `domain/{name}/product.md` (or `product/{name}/domain/{name}/product.md`).

Stage (applies to `product` and `domain` scope only):

- `--stage pitch` — Phase 0 (pre-foundation-sprint): Shape Up format, ≤2 pages.
  Write before epics exist. Sections: Problem / Appetite / Sketch / Rabbit holes
  / No-gos.
- `--stage product` — Phase 2+ (post-walking-skeleton): extended format.
  Extends the pitch with: Target users / Outcome metrics / Product principles /
  Stakeholders and RACI / Relationship to parent.

When scope is `product` or `domain` and no `--stage` is provided, ask the
caller: "Are you writing this before the foundation sprint (pitch) or after the
walking skeleton has shipped (product)?"

## Frontmatter convention

Every product.md MUST include `type: Product Strategy` and `scope:` in its
frontmatter:

```yaml
type: Product Strategy
scope: portfolio   # portfolio | product | domain
```

For domain scope, also include `parent_product:` pointing to the owning
product's `product/product.md`.

## Negative constraints

The product.md MUST NOT contain:

- File paths, module names, or class names → belongs in `solution.md`
- API endpoints, HTTP verbs, schemas, or type aliases → belongs in `solution.md` or `contracts.md`
- Tech stack names (React, Next.js, Zustand, etc.) → belongs in `solution.md`
- ADR numbers or decision rationales → belongs in `solution.md §9`
- Deployment topology or environment details → belongs in `solution.md §8`
- Component or service names → belongs in `solution.md §4`

## Context

<artifacts>
[Provided by the caller:
  Portfolio scope: the products being bound, their theses, commercial model,
  sequencing rationale, boundary decisions, open questions.
  Pitch stage: problem statement, appetite (time/team budget), known constraints.
  Product stage: pitch-stage product.md, user research, metric baselines,
  stakeholder map, parent product strategy.]
</artifacts>

## Steps (portfolio scope)

1. Read all provided context before writing anything
2. Write §1 What we are building — two to three sentences per product: what it
   is and who it is for. No strategy, no implementation.
3. Write §2 Core thesis — why these products belong together. What is the
   combined bet? What would break if either product were missing?
4. Write §3 Commercial model — how the portfolio makes money. Name the
   give-away vs premium split, licensing stances, and distribution preferences.
5. Write §4 Product responsibilities — a boundary table: which concerns each
   product owns, reads, or does not touch. Make every boundary explicit.
6. Write §5 Strategic discipline — the no-crossing rules. Which primitives must
   stay in which product and why. Name the failure mode if a boundary erodes.
7. Write §6 Sequencing — which product ships first and why. What the second
   product depends on the first having proven.
8. Write §7 Open questions — decisions that must be made but are not yet made.
   State a preferred direction where one exists.
9. **Delete the `DRAFTING AIDE` comment block before saving.**

## Steps (pitch stage — product or domain scope)

1. Read all provided context before writing anything
2. Write §1 Problem — what is currently broken or missing? Specific, evidence-based bullet points
3. Write §2 Appetite — how much is the team willing to invest? Name the phases or the cycle length
4. Write §3 Sketch — what the solution delivers end-to-end, in plain language; a Figma link or ASCII sketch if available; no implementation detail
5. Write §4 Rabbit holes — risks the product will deliberately stay out of; each as a named, opinionated bullet
6. Write §5 No-gos — explicit out-of-scope for this cycle; each item with a one-line reason
7. **Delete the `DRAFTING AIDE` comment block before saving.**

## Steps (product stage — product or domain scope)

1. Read all provided context and the existing pitch-stage product.md if present
2. Carry forward §1–§5 from the pitch, updated if needed
3. Write §6 Target users — primary, secondary, and explicitly out-of-scope segments; per segment: who they are, their context, what success looks like for them
4. Write §7 Outcome metrics — product-level outcomes only; numeric thresholds live in `solution.md §2.1` and `metrics.md`; reference those docs rather than restating numbers
5. Write §8 Product principles — commercial / product-level principles only; engineering principles belong in `solution.md`
6. Write §9 Stakeholders and RACI — who owns what, consulted or informed
7. Write §10 Relationship to the parent — how this product or domain fits the wider sequencing; what downstream phases depend on it
8. **Delete the `DRAFTING AIDE` comment block before saving.**

## Quality rules

- Must read as-is to a non-technical stakeholder without a glossary
- Portfolio scope: ≤4 pages
- Pitch stage: ≤2 pages
- Domain product stage: ≤3 pages. Product product stage: ≤5 pages
- Portfolio §4 boundary table must have a row for every cross-product concern
- Portfolio §5 must name at least one primitive that must NOT cross the boundary
- §4 Rabbit holes must be opinionated — name what the product will NOT do
- §7 Outcome metrics must NOT contain raw numeric thresholds — say "meet the bar in solution.md §2.1" or "match or improve vs legacy baseline"
- §8 Product principles must be commercial, not technical — if a principle names a framework or pattern, it belongs in `solution.md`
- Do not invent requirements — derive everything from provided context
- **Delete the `DRAFTING AIDE` comment block before saving the output file.**

## Output format

Write as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter including `type: Product Strategy`
and `scope: portfolio|product|domain`.

- Portfolio scope: save as `product/product.md`
- Product scope (single-product workspace): save as `product/product.md`
- Product scope (within a portfolio): save as `product/{name}/product.md`
- Domain scope: save as `domain/{name}/product.md`

Use `template-portfolio.md` for portfolio scope, `template-pitch.md` for
pitch stage, `template-product.md` for product stage.

<example>
See `examples/cart-product.md` (domain scope, product stage)
See `examples/space-product.md` (product scope, product stage)
</example>
