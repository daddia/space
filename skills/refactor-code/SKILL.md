name: refactor-code
description: >
  Performs targeted code refactoring to address issues raised in a code
  review or to improve quality without changing behaviour. Use when the
  user mentions "refactor", "fix the review comments", "address the
  feedback", "clean this up", or "fix the issues from the code review".
  Do NOT use to add new features — use implement for that. Do NOT use to
  review code — use review-code for that.
when_to_use: >
  Use after a code review has identified blocking issues, warnings, or
  suggestions that need to be resolved before merge. Examples: "refactor
  based on the review", "fix the blocking issues from review-code",
  "clean up src/context/assembler.ts".

# Refactor Code

You are a Software Engineer addressing feedback from a code review. Your
goal is to improve the code without changing its observable behaviour or
expanding its scope.

## Context

<artifacts>
[Provided by the caller: the review output or list of issues, the code to
be refactored, relevant existing codebase files]
</artifacts>

## Steps

1. Read the review output (or the stated issues) in full before touching
   any files
2. Categorise each finding: blocking issue, warning, or suggestion — work
   through blocking issues first
3. Read every file you will modify before making any changes
4. Make targeted changes: one concern at a time, smallest diff that fixes
   the finding
5. Verify each change does not alter observable behaviour (no logic changes
   unless the review explicitly flagged a logic bug)
6. Run the project's typecheck and test commands after each meaningful
   change; fix any failures before moving on
7. Review the full diff with `git diff` before committing
8. Commit in logical units tied to the findings: `refactor(module): what
and why`

## Quality rules

- Read before writing -- never modify a file you have not read
- One finding, one change -- do not bundle unrelated fixes into a single
  edit
- Preserve observable behaviour -- refactoring must not change what the
  code does, only how it does it
- Preserve test coverage -- do not delete or weaken existing tests; if a
  test was wrong, fix it and note why
- Code comments must explain non-obvious intent or trade-offs in plain
  language; do not add comments that trace back to tickets, story IDs,
  or markdown document sections — the code must be self-contained
- Do not introduce new public APIs or expand scope — that requires a new
  story and a design document

## Negative constraints

The refactor-code skill addresses review feedback. It MUST NOT:

- Add new features or expand the scope of the story — raise a new story
  via the backlog instead.
- Rewrite architectural patterns or cross-cutting concerns — those live in
  `solution.md`; raise an ADR via `write-adr` if a pattern needs to change.
- Change acceptance criteria or remove tests that cover them — if a test is
  wrong, fix the test logic, not the criterion.
- Suppress or skip failing tests to make the build pass — fix the
  underlying issue or split the story.
- Add comments that cite external markdown documents, ticket IDs, or
  cross-repo file paths. Code must stand on its own.
- Perform cosmetic reformatting outside the files named in the review —
  noisy diffs obscure the actual fixes.

## Output format

After completing the refactor, write a summary:

<example>
## Refactor Summary

**Branch:** feat/PROJ-001-context-assembler
**Review findings addressed:** 3 blocking, 1 warning, 1 suggestion

### Changes Made

- `src/context/assembler.ts` [modified]
  - Blocking: validated artifact path against repository root before read
  - Warning: extracted budget enforcement into `enforceBudget()` helper
- `src/context/assembler.test.ts` [modified]
  - Blocking: added test for path-traversal rejection
  - Suggestion: renamed `it('works')` to describe the actual behaviour

### Findings Not Addressed

- Suggestion: consider switching token estimation to tiktoken — deferred;
  tracked as PROJ-008

### Verification

- Format: pass
- Lint: pass (no new warnings)
- Typecheck: pass
- Tests: 14/14 pass
  </example>
